# NFT Signature Verification Implementation on Ralph/Alephium

## Overview 🎯
The **SignatureNFT** system implements a gas-efficient whitelist mechanism using ECDSA signature verification, following Alephium's [Non-fungible Token Standard](https://docs.alephium.org/dapps/standards/non-fungible-tokens/). Compared to traditional Merkle Tree approaches, this signature-based system offers a more economical solution for whitelist management as signatures are generated off-chain, requiring no gas fees for whitelist distribution.

## Whitelist Implementation 📋

### **Cost-Efficient Design**
- **Off-Chain Signatures**:
 - Project team signs whitelist addresses off-chain
 - No gas costs for whitelist distribution
 - Can include specific tokenId allocation per address
- **Advantages over Merkle Tree**:
 - Reduced gas consumption
 - Flexible whitelist management
 - Simplified proof verification

### **Whitelist Process**
1. **Project Team** (Off-chain):
   - Signs eligible addresses with project wallet
   - Can specify mintable tokenIds per address
   - Distributes signatures to whitelist members

2. **Users** (On-chain):
   - Submit signature during minting
   - Contract verifies eligibility
   - Mint succeeds if signature valid

## Contract Features 🚀

### **Signature Verification System**
- **Signature Validation**:
 - Verifies signature authenticity using ecRecover
 - Validates signer authority against authorized addresses
 - Processes message hash inputs for verification
- **Message Processing**:
 - Creates standardized message hashes
 - Applies Alephium-specific prefixing
 - Ensures signature uniqueness per mint

### **NFT Minting Logic**
- **Controlled Minting**:
 - Only processes valid signatures
 - Requires authorized signer approval
 - Links tokens to specific addresses
- **Minting Flow**:
 - Validates signature authenticity
 - Checks for previous mints
 - Creates new NFT token
- **State Management**:
 - Tracks minted addresses
 - Maintains token ownership
 - Records minting history

### **Authorization System**
- **Signer Management**:
 - Immutable authorized signer address
 - Set during contract deployment
- **Access Control**:
 - Validates signer permissions
 - Prevents unauthorized minting
 - Enforces single-mint policy

## How It Works 🔧

### Whitelist Minting Process
1. **Signature Creation** (Off-chain):
   ```typescript
   // Project team creates whitelist signature
   signature = projectWallet.sign(
       keccak256(whitelistAddress + tokenId)
   )
   ```

2. **Verification** (On-chain):
   ```typescript
   // Contract verifies whitelist status
   mint(
       address: Address,
       tokenId: U256,
       signature: ByteVec
   ) -> {
       // Verify signature matches project wallet
       // Check address hasn't minted
       // Process mint if valid
   }
   ```

3. **NFT Creation**:
   - Upon successful verification
   - Mints NFT to specified address
   - Records mint in contract state

## Security Features 🔒
- **Signature Validation**: Complete signature verification
- **Mint Protection**: Prevents double-minting
- **Signer Control**: Immutable authorized signers
- **Message Safety**: Standardized hash generation
- **State Tracking**: Comprehensive mint recording
- **Access Control**: Strict permission enforcement
