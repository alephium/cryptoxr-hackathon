# Dutch Auction NFT Implementation on Ralph/Alephium

## Overview üéØ
The **Dutch Auction NFT** contract implements a declining price auction mechanism for NFT minting. Starting at a higher price that gradually decreases over time until reaching a floor price, this system provides a fair and efficient price discovery mechanism for NFT minting.Implement with Alephium's [Non-fungible Token Standard](https://docs.alephium.org/dapps/standards/non-fungible-tokens/)
